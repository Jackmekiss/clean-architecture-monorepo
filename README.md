# monorepo-clean-architecture-tdd

This project aims to showcase the power and effectiveness of the Clean Architecture pattern, implemented in a monorepo using [Nx Dev](https://nx.dev/).

It is a fake chat application, built with React and Typescript, applying `Test Driven Development` (TDD) principles. The monorepo architecture allows for modular and decoupled code, promoting code reuse and making it easier to manage dependencies.

The monorepo is structured as follows:
-   `lib/core` - Contains everything related to the domain.
	-  `lib/core/src/initReduxStore` - Initializes the Redux store for orchestration.
	-   `lib/core/src/{module}/adapters/{primary | secondary}` - Houses the stubs or integrations for dependency inversion.
	-   `lib/core/src/{module}/apis` - Contains the API files for Redux RTK.
	- `lib/core/src/{module}/domain` - Contains the domain model data along with builders.
	-   `lib/core/src/{module}/gateways` - Provides interfaces for the secondary adapters.
	-   `lib/core/src/{module}/use-cases` - Represents explicit use cases.
-    `apps/web` - Houses all the React code for the web application.
